## Usage
### Setting up
- Download the entire repository on your system.
- Inside the folder named FlappyRockets, there's a FlappyRockets.pde file.
- Open it using Processing 3.
- Tweak the source code as per your wish.
- Click the play button to run the code.
### Program Controls
Currently, the player uses his mouse to control the spaceship. My end goal with this project is to use a miniature physical spaceship as the controller instead of a mouse so that the interactivity of the game can be made more intuitive. Currently to survive in the game the player has to avoid hitting any incoming asteroids using his mouse.
