## Usage
### Setting up
- Download the entire repository on your system.
- Inside the folder named FlappyRockets, there's a FlappyRockets.pde file.
- Open it using Processing 3.
- Tweak the source code as per your wish.
- Click the play button to run the code.
### Program Controls
Currently, the player uses his mouse to control the spaceship. My end goal with this project is to build a miniature physical spaceship to be used as its controller instead of a mouse to improve upon its interactivity and make it more intuitive. Currently, to survive in the game the player has to avoid hitting any incoming asteroids using his mouse.
