# Into Darkness

## About
This is a game in which you along with your spaceship together has to invade incoming asteroids from the darkness of the space. Use your mouse to dodge the asteroids by moving upwards and downwards in space. 

## Usage
### Setting up
- Download the entire repository on your system.
- Inside the folder named FlappyRockets, there's a FlappyRockets.pde file.
- Open it using Processing 3.
- Tweak the source code as per your wish.
- Click the play button to run the code.
### Program Controls
Currently, the player uses his mouse to control the spaceship. My main aim is to use a miniature physical spaceship instead of a mouse so that the interactivity of the game can be made more intuitive. The player has to avoid hitting any incoming asteroids.
